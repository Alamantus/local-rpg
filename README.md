## Goal
To have a locally hosted pen and paper RPG experience using laptops and various other devices connected via wifi. The Dungeon/Game Master will use a laptop or desktop computer to manage and display character and monster info, maps, and various other assets. All players can roll dice (and the DM/GM can create custom dice), and display their rolls.

## Usage

_Every time you pull from the repo, be sure to re-run the install step in case something got added to the project._

### Install

`yarn` will install all the required `node_modules` and allow you to build and run the app.

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as our package managerâ€”please avoid using `npm install`. NPM is only used to run scripts instead of installing and managing dependencies.

### Build and Run

`npm run start` will build the host and client and start running the host Electron app.  
`npm run dev` will start webpack watchers and the host Electron app, which will refresh on every change to `build` folder.

Access player client by going to localhost at the port you entered or using the "Players connect to" url on the Electron app while the device is connected to the same WiFi/network as the host.
