# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing dev@alamantus.com.

### 1. Be friendly, patient, and helpful

Everyone has something to contribute. Everyone deserves access to materials and a community that will help them learn. We strive to be such a community, and we want everyone who wants to contribute to improve so they can get better at contributing.

### 2. Be welcoming

We want this project and any associated interactions to be a safe place for people. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### 3. Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

### 4. Be respectful

Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the community.

### 5. Choose your words carefully

We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person _(be aggressive elsewhere)_.
* Discriminatory jokes and language _(nobody likes assholes)_.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material _(does this seriously need to be said?)_.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing") _(again, nobody likes assholes)_.
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms _(see above regarding assholes)_.
* Unwelcome sexual attention _(for example, don't ask anyone out on a date)_.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior _(nobody likes enablers, either)_.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop _(seriously, come on)_.

### 6. When we disagree, try to understand why

Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Github is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of being Open Source comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

# Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and other spaces where communication about the project happens. This includes email, Slack or other chat/instant messaging platforms like IRC, the issue tracker, social media, and any other forums created by the project team which the community uses for communication. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

# Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at dev@alamantus.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
